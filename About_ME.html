            I am a game developer. I have created over five games. Now you might think thats less but its much if you think about the work. I bet you were 
             searching for something interesting but reached here. Well I am glad to tell that you should follow your passion. And never give up your DREAM. You have probably heard this speech from you parents or other influencers 
             But I am here to give you something else I am here to give you a head. After reading everything yu might get it.

             Do you wanna become an app developer or even make your website. Use mine for starters. It might help you a lot. I think I forgot to introduce myself. Well I am Aisha Razaan. Currently in grade 8 And
             my life is pretty hectic. If you came here searching for something formal then I am not the right place or in other words GET OUT! Sorry. Look 
             I am just here to encourge you to do something you love.

        <h1>
             Have you ever thought how games you play,apps you use on a daily basis like instagram or even this website are made. Well I am here to help beginners for
             this purpose. Not to be rude but you probably wouldn't have read the whole thing and didnt even reach here but for those who did I would like to congratulate 
             that you atleast have the will to read this much. Today's problem : everyone has stuck their noses in screens for useless information so take some time 
             to know your family or do something useful like coding which can improve technology. This is just a little from me. You can get more from your elders. 
             These useless information should stop to save you time which is priceless. I won't bother you anymore.Luv Life :)  #TeamHead
